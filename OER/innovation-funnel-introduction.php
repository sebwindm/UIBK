		<h1>Introduction </h1>
		<!-- <p>Open innovation contests can be a good way to drive research and development obtaining innovative ideas developed by a large crowd of people. Historically, innovation contests have been around for a long time. Notable examples are an innovation contest for developing a substitute for butter in 1869, which led to the invention of margarine, finding a method of accurately determining a ship’s longitude in 1714, or "The Daily Mail prize for crossing the Atlantic" from 1913, which led to the first nonstop flight across the atlantic in 1919 (Adamczyk et al. 2012). <br>
With the advance in information and communication technology, innovation contests have moved online. Online platforms allow users to competitively disclose their creative ideas to corporations and also to interact and collaborate with like-minded peers. This collaboration can happen in the form of communicating, discussing, and sharing insights and experiences, building social networks, and establishing a sense of community (Hutter et al. 2011).<br>
The goal of an innovation contest is to identify the winning ideas among a pile of many idea submissions. Online innovation contests can result in hundreds and thousands of submissions. The process of reducing many generated ideas to a few promising ideas is called convergence. <br>
The phases of innovation contests can be visualized with the Innovation Funnel, which is wide at the beginning and narrows down towards  the end. The innovation funnel features up to four phases namely, the generation phase, the filtering phase, the shortlisting phase, and the winner determination phase. The process of identifying a winning idea  is challenging due to multiple selection problems. Sifting through this large pile of ideas requires a well thought out strategy. For this purpose, organizations make use of selection methods to design effective selection processes and to prevent negative consequences, which could slow down the process or hinder the selection of the best idea(s).<br>
The innovation funnel is based on the "Product Development Funnel" by Wheelwright and Clark (1992), but has been adapted to show the convergence process at the example of innovation contests. In the following, we provide selected details of the  four phases of innovation contests. <a href="innovation-funnel.php" style="text-decoration: none;">Click here </a> to see the innovation funnel in practice.
