			<h1>Introduction</h1><p class="regular">
				The following section gives an introduction into the challenges that might occur when selecting the best idea out of a large pile. In the context of the
<a href="http://iwi.uibk.ac.at/umic/" target="_blank">UMIC</a>
				 research project, we identified 10 selection challenges. The selection challenges are shortly summarized and described in more detail in so-called problem scenarios. The short descriptions aim at making the reader aware of the inherent problems of the selection challenge and problem scenarios give insights into current practice where those problems exist. Problem scenarios are fictive stories of users, their actions, and their goals.To structure a problem scenario, information about the stakeholder’s values and activities should be collected. Acquiring rich and diverse data about the needs of the stakeholders and the potential future opportunities provides a better understanding of the current situation and allows the potential developer to identify optimal solutions for the current issues. By conducting an in-depth qualitative study, the researchers of the UMIC research project acquired rich data to identify the current issues of the stakeholders and their future needs.
